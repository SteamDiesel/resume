See my resume deployed on netlify [here](https://distracted-williams-cdda80.netlify.app/).

### How it works

It utilises the local storage in the browser to store cover letters for different roles.

### Stack
This project is a simple Vue.js single page application (SPA) with no API or server, so it can easily (and freely) be deployed on netlify cdn.
For this project I've implemented basic Vue.js without Vue-router or vuex for state control.
I've used Tailwindcss to style.
